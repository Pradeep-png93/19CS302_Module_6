## EX 27 C PROGRAM TO DECLARE DATATYPE USING TYPEDEF
## AIM:
To write a C program that demonstrates the use of typedef to create a new alias name for a data type.

## Algorithm
1.	Start.
2.	Declare a variable value of type char.
3.	Prompt the user to enter a value.
4.	Read the value using scanf.
5.	Check eligible for marriage.
6.	If age >= 21, print "Eligible".
7.	If false, print " Not Eligible".
8.	End.

## Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>
typedef int MyInt;
int main() {
 MyInt num = 10;
 printf("The value of num is: %d\n", num);
 return 0;
}
```

## Output:
